# datascience_exam

### Structure of notebooks
Notebooks are numbered (1,2,3) and they are supposed to be run in the order.
- 1_data_wrangling: Cleans, preprocesses and plots the data
- 2_embeddings: Embed three different text columns and reduces their dimensions with PCA. PCA reduced embeddings are clustered. 
- 3_building_models: As the name suggest, in this script different models are built. From a dummy 'mean' model to a RandomForestRegressor. 

### Data
The data set is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imoore/age-dataset (Annamoradnejad & Annamoradnejad (2022)


The data used for the exam is uploaded in the data folder as a zipped file. 

The text embeddings used in the models are too big for GitHub even when zipped, so if you don't want to run the entire code, the files can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ryos5F4kH5VcHczO7J7RyK33-x1YRduU?usp=sharing
